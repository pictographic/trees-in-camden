# Trees in the London Borough of Camden
Work in progress on better JavaScript version of [this experiment](https://public.tableau.com/profile/adam.davis7675#!/vizhome/TreesinCamden/Treecover) that was initially put together with [Free Data Visualization Software | Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com).

## The idea
I live in Camden and I appreciate the leafy aspect to my home - and this seems a useful way to experiment with these urban mapping and data capabilities.

## The data
[Trees In Camden - Datasets](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/trees-in-camden) - available from the [data.gov.uk open data portal](https://data.gov.uk)

## The technologies
